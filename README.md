# Bus Filter Framework
A framework for Windows KMDF-based upper filter drivers to behave as bus filters. You don't need to write WDM drivers any more!
# Sample Driver
Check the code in the BusFilter directory as well as ReadMe.htm in the WDKStorPortVirtualMiniport directory. To build the sample driver, open mp\mp.sln with Visual Studio Community Edition.
